After spending the morning pricing new screens for my cracked iPhone 5s, I broke down and went toifixandrepair an online/local franchise for iPhone repair. Once there I asked about price matching, because I had found a few other place a little further away that were cheaper, only to be told they did not price match.

Oh well ... but I found that the parent company and local stores did sell parts and surprisingly they were by far some of the cheapest prices for parts of any quality. So if you are the type bold enough to do a little DIY project [ifarparts.com](https://ifarparts.com) or there local locations have just about every thing you need to fix most major issue with you idevice.[^1]
