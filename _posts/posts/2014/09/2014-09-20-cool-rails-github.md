###Cool Rails projects I come across on the web each week.

[<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/github_hp.jpg" boarder="10">](https://github.com)  
<br>
This week my pick is [Github](https://github.com) from Github,Inc[^1]  
<br>
While I'm sure most of you know what github is and does, a little rehash for those who don't ... Github is a repsotory powered by Git[^2], with some other cool tools.  
<br>
While not new by any means 

<br>
__The Tech:__
<br>

[^1]:Github was originally started by Tom [Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo), [Chris Wanstrath](https://github.com/defunkt), and [PJ Hyett](https://github.com/pjhyett).
[^2]:Not to be confused with Git the version control cli tool. For a little better explination see this great post ['Is Git the Same Thing as Github!?'](http://www.jahya.net/blog/?2013-05-git-vs-github) by [Andrew McWilliams](https://github.com/microcosm).
