There are some companies who really get customer service and have incredible attention to detail; Warby Parker is definitely one of those companies that just get it. From hand writen notes to personalized styling tips via youtube with suggestions on new looks you might like, to unique boutique experiances in there physical locations.

Today when I came home I found a cool gift [^1]from Warby for being a valued customer. I thought this was really cool and just a great example as to why the attention to details can set you apart from your competition.

[^1]:The gift was a copy of [ _On the Road: The Original Scroll (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)_ ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143105469/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687662&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0140283293&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=00CG7Q75TMDYKKD4KK2N), along with a hand written note by one of the Warby team memebers.
