Last week was the kickoff of a vary new and interesting experiance for me. Week one at [Ironhack](http://ironhack.com/) (A dev bootcamp in beautiful Miami) just came to an end and I am exeramely excited. In one week alone I feel like I've learned a tremendous amount, and have started to build out a great new network of exermelly talented people. I can not wait to push forward with my follow members in my cohort, both here in Miami and our sister campus in barcelona. Good luck to my fellow classmates!
