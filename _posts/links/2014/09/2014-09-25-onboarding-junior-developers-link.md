I really liked the overview of this talk specifically:

>Phase 3 (Beyond)
>
>* 1 on 1s - setup your ongoing 1 on 1 with your boss and mentor. Kate even encouraged the idea that anyone in the company should be allowed to setup a 1 on 1 with anyone. 
>* Goal setting and feedback - this is important and something we embrace at Ninefold. You should always striving to go forward in your career and you should outline how you are going to achieve that with your manager. 
>* Presentations - once your employee is comfortable, start adding them into presentations (both internal and external) so they can grow their skills and share insights with others.

Generally speaking, these are some really good ideas that are often promised in some form but rarely executed well. If a company can get this last part down that would be a place where I would be highly interested in working.
