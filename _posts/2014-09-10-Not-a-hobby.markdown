['Not a hobby'](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/not-a-hobby/) over at [randsinrepose.com](randsinrepose.com) caught my eye when questioning why Apple changed gears in the way it lunched the  watch.
<br><br>
If I had to guess my self I would say it was a combination of the _"Watch refresh cycles are going to be longer."_ and _"It’s just one product with different attributes and accessories."_.
<br><br>
As a mechanical watch lover, I was really not all that interested in the rumors of the product. Though after seeing some shoots from the [Hodinkee review](http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review) it got me to thinking. The simple fact that Hodinkee was invited to the unveil speakers to the first guess. And the fact that pretty much everyone agreed that Apple hit a home run with there steps and bands speaks to the second.
