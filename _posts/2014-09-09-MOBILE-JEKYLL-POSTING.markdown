After finally getting off my hands and creating a personal blog, I choose to go with Jekyll hosted on github pages. 
I have used and worked on CMS and web services like Xanga, blogger, and Squarespace  in the past which were all met my needs at the time but I this go around I wanted maximum flexibility with little fuss. Like dozens of people who have gone down this road before me know, Jekyll is very powerful, however  you give up some features you may be accustomed to having right out of the box.   

My main goal with this project was to get  ideas out when 140 characters would not work. Every now and again this happens when I'm not sitting in front of a computer. While I can do this in the web browser on my iOS devices, it felt very clunky and didn't really give me a way to work on a draft. I ran across a really cool app [Octopage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopage-blogging-jekyll-markdown/id649843345?mt=8) but it is/was and iPhone only app. Then I stumbled on to a post by Steven Combs['Posting to a Jekyll blog from an iPad'](http://www.stevencombs.com/web/2014/07/01/post-to-a-jekyll-blog-from-an-ipad.html) which reminded me of the power of Editorial which is my full blown text editor of choose for my iOS devices.  

The part in the post that got me to do more digging was when Steven reference d Editorials Python script-ability and workflow creation. A little more searching around the web and bam I had what I needed. Malphas Wats had a [github gist](https://gist.github.com/MalphasWats/7977513) with the Python script I needed to push my post and a TextExpander snippet handles my ymal headers.[^1]
