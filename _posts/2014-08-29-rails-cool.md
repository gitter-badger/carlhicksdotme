####Cool Rails projects I come across on the web each week.

[<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/citystrides_hp.jpg" border="10">](http://citystrides.com/)  
<br>  
This week my pick is [CityStrides.com](http://citystrides.com/) by [James Chevalier](http://jameschevalier.us)  
<br>  
CityStrides is a web app that gives you streetviews of all your runs (that include geo data) from RunKepper, Strava, and MapMyFitness. This is a web app after my own heart, with its intersting use of several data types, cuppled with another hobby of mine, running.[^1]  
<br>
Besides being a really cool app from a tech perspective, can't wait to get out and try to run all the streets in my town.  
<br>  
__The Tech:__  
<br>
[OpenSteetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about)  
[RunKeepers api (HealthGraph)](http://developer.runkeeper.com/healthgraph)  
[Forcast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/)  
<br>  
<br>  

[^1]: I came across this app while listening to the [Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/165) hosted by [Sean Devine](http://5by5.tv/people/sean-devine) of the [5by5.tv](http://5by5.tv/) network.
