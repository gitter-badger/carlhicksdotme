####Cool Rails projects I come across on the web each week.

[<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/nyc_votes_mp.jpg" border="10">](https://nycvotes.org/)
<br>  
This week my pick is [NYC Votes](https://www.nycvotes.org) from [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com), along with [Method](http://method.com/) and [AppOrchard](http://www.apporchard.com), helped the [New York City Campaign Finance Board (CFB)](http://www.nyccfb.info/) and its [Voter Assistance Committee (VAAC)](http://www.nyccfb.info/public/VRC/about_vaac.htm) to create a mobile website that streamlines the political process for voters and candidates alike.  
<br>
NYC Votes is a public-private partnership to promote voter registration, participation and civic engagement in elections through technology.
