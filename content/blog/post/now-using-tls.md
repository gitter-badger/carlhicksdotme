By now most of us have seen some evidence or heard a argument for "HTTPS Everywhere". Generally speaking I've been a little hesitant to jump on the train. Even knowing some of the basic surface level upsides in some cases it just seemed like over kill and a added complication to maintaining a basic website. However I have come to the conclusion that no matter what I think the over all tide have shifted and the day is coming. So with that being the case I set off to find out just how much of a headache I was in for.  

Surprisingly I found that this process has gotten easier then it once was [IMO] and that the benefit outweigh any minor problems you might run into in implementing.

I'm in the process of writing up the steps and will post those sometime in the near future but if your not using TLS ... well you probably should be.
